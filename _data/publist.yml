  image: fg24.jpg
  description: This paper addresses the problem of diversity-aware sign language production, where we want to give an image (or sequence) of a signer and produce another image with the same pose but different attributes (e.g. gender, skin color).

  image: bmvc22.jpg
  description:  Multi-view video synthesis generates the scene dynamics from a viewpoint given a source view and one or more modalities of a targeted view. In this paper, we frame video synthesis as a feature learning problem and solve it as target-view motion synthesis with spatial refinement.

- title: "Novel-view human action synthesis"
  image: 
  description:  Novel-View Human Action Synthesis aims to synthesize the movement of a body from a virtual viewpoint, given a video from a real viewpoint. We present a novel 3D reasoning to synthesize the target viewpoint. We first estimate the 3D mesh of the target body and transfer the rough textures from the 2D images to the mesh. As this transfer may generate sparse textures on the mesh due to frame resolution or occlusions.

  image: iccv19.jpg
  description:  We tackle the problem of synthesizing a video of multiple moving people as seen from a novel view, given only an input video and depth information or human poses of the novel view as prior. This problem requires a model that learns to transform input features into target features while maintaining temporal consistency.

- title: "Pose guided human image synthesis by view disentanglement and enhanced weighting loss"
  image: eccvw18.jpg
  description: View synthesis aims at generating a novel, unseen view of an object. This is a challenging task in the presence of occlusions and asymmetries. In this paper, we present View-Disentangled Generator (VDG), a two-stage deep network for pose-guided human-image generation that performs coarse view prediction followed by a refinement stage.
