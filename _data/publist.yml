  image: fg24.jpg
  description: This paper addresses the problem of diversity-aware sign language production, where we want to give an image (or sequence) of a signer and produce another image with the same pose but different attributes (e.g. gender, skin color).

- title: "Implicit texture mapping for multi-view video synthesis"
  image: bmvc22.jpg
  description:  Multi-view video synthesis generates the scene dynamics from a viewpoint given a source view and one or more modalities of a targeted view. In this paper, we frame video synthesis as a feature learning problem and solve it as target-view motion synthesis with spatial refinement.
